Research on what an API is:
- https://www.ibm.com/topics/api
	- Definition: a way for developers to integrate code, capabilities, and functions from other applications for their projects so they don’t have to develop them from scratch.
	- Benefits:
		- Improved collaboration: allows multiple applications to effortlessly communicate with each other.
		- Accelerated innovation: allows API owners to make connections with new businesses and build upon their API.
		- System security: Adds security during data exchange
	- Types of APIs:
		- Open API: open source APIs that can be accessed with the HTTP protocol (this is the type of API we will be using for our project)
		- Partner API: connect strategic business partners
		- Internal APIs: APIs hidden from external users (only for the company that owns it)
		- Composite APIs: combine multiple data or service APIs.

	- How an API works:
		- An API works as a communication medium between two programs
		- A client (the user) sends a request and the server is the backend (which processes the request and generates a response).
			- Client sends a request via the API’s URL
			- The API makes a call to the server after receiving the request 
			- The server sends the response to the request back to the API
			- The API transfers the response to the client
